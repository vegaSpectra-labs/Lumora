# Astera Contract API Reference

## Overview

Astera is a real-world assets (RWA) platform on Stellar that enables SMEs to tokenize unpaid invoices and tap into a community-funded liquidity pool. The system consists of two smart contracts: an **Invoice Contract** that manages the lifecycle of tokenized invoices, and a **Pool Contract** that handles investor deposits, co-funding, yield distribution, and repayment settlements. This API reference documents every public method in both contracts with complete parameter specifications, return types, error conditions, and usage examples.

## Data Types

### Invoice Contract Types

#### `Invoice`
The core record storing invoice metadata and lifecycle state.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `u64` | Unique invoice identifier, sequential starting from 1 |
| `owner` | `Address` | Invoice owner (typically SME/creator) |
| `debtor` | `String` | Counterparty name or label (e.g., "ACME Corp") |
| `amount` | `i128` | Face value in smallest units (7 decimals for USDC on Stellar; 1 USDC = 10,000,000) |
| `due_date` | `u64` | Unix timestamp (ledger seconds) when payment is due |
| `description` | `String` | Human-readable invoice description (e.g., "Invoice #001 - Goods delivery") |
| `status` | `InvoiceStatus` | Current state: `Pending`, `Funded`, `Paid`, or `Defaulted` |
| `created_at` | `u64` | Unix timestamp when invoice was created |
| `funded_at` | `u64` | Unix timestamp when invoice was funded (0 until funded) |
| `paid_at` | `u64` | Unix timestamp when invoice was marked paid (0 until paid) |
| `pool_contract` | `Address` | Address of the pool contract that funded this invoice |

**Location in Source:** [contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs](../contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs)

#### `InvoiceStatus`
Enum representing the state of an invoice.

| Variant | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `Pending` | Invoice created but not yet funded |
| `Funded` | Invoice has been fully funded by the pool, funds disbursed to SME |
| `Paid` | Invoice repaid in full |
| `Defaulted` | Invoice missed due date with no repayment |

**Location in Source:** [contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs](../contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs)

#### `InvoiceMetadata`
A wallet and explorer-friendly view of an invoice, derived from the stored `Invoice` record without duplicating storage. Aligns with SEP-0041 conventions for token metadata.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | `String` | Human-readable title, e.g. `Astera Invoice #1` |
| `description` | `String` | Invoice description from the underlying `Invoice` record |
| `image` | `String` | Placeholder asset URI for artwork (currently a static placeholder; future versions will support per-invoice art) |
| `amount` | `i128` | Face value in smallest units (same as underlying `Invoice.amount`) |
| `debtor` | `String` | Counterparty/debtor label (same as underlying `Invoice.debtor`) |
| `due_date` | `u64` | Unix timestamp when payment is due (same as underlying `Invoice.due_date`) |
| `status` | `InvoiceStatus` | Current invoice status (`Pending`, `Funded`, `Paid`, or `Defaulted`) |
| `symbol` | `String` | Short ticker in SEP-0041 format, e.g. `INV-1`, `INV-2`, etc. |
| `decimals` | `u32` | Always `7`, indicating amounts are in units of 10^-7 (aligns with USDC on Stellar) |

**Location in Source:** [contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs](../contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs)

**SEP Alignment Notes:**
- `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` correspond to SEP-0041 token metadata fields
- `image` follows standard JSON metadata conventions (e.g., NFT-style metadata)
- UIsto serialize `InvoiceMetadata` to JSON for wallet display

---

### Pool Contract Types

#### `PoolConfig`
Configuration and aggregated metrics for the pool.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `invoice_contract` | `Address` | Address of the authorized Invoice Contract |
| `admin` | `Address` | Current admin address; required for privileged operations |
| `yield_bps` | `u32` | Annual yield in basis points (e.g., 800 = 8% APY); cannot exceed 5000 (50%) |

**Location in Source:** [contracts/pool/src/lib.rs](../contracts/pool/src/lib.rs)

**Notes:** Default `yield_bps` is 800 (8% APY). The pool does not store total_deposited, total_deployed, total_paid_out in PoolConfig; those are tracked per token in `PoolTokenTotals`.

#### `PoolTokenTotals`
Aggregated accounting metrics for a specific stablecoin within the pool.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `total_deposited` | `i128` | Cumulative amount deposited (including earned interest credited back) |
| `total_deployed` | `i128` | Amount currently locked in active invoices |
| `total_paid_out` | `i128` | Cumulative total paid out (principal + interest) |

**Location in Source:** [contracts/pool/src/lib.rs](../contracts/pool/src/lib.rs)

**Notes:** `available_liquidity` for a token = `total_deposited - total_deployed`. Interest earnings are added to `total_deposited` when invoices are repaid.

#### `InvestorPosition`
Per-investor, per-token accounting of deposits, deployments, earnings, and deposit history.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `deposited` | `i128` | Net amount ever deposited by this investor in this token (cumulative, net of withdrawals) |
| `available` | `i128` | Undeployed balance available for withdrawal or future commitments |
| `deployed` | `i128` | Amount currently locked in active invoices (unavailable for withdrawal until invoices are repaid) |
| `earned` | `i128` | Total interest accumulated from repaid invoices in this token |
| `deposit_count` | `u32` | Count of successful deposit operations (for UX/analytics) |

**Location in Source:** [contracts/pool/src/lib.rs](../contracts/pool/src/lib.rs)

**Notes:** Invariant: `available + deployed = deposited + earned` (at any state). Available balance can be withdrawn at any time.

#### `FundedInvoice`
Record of an invoice opened for co-funding. Tracks funding progress and repayment state.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `invoice_id` | `u64` | ID of the invoice from the Invoice Contract |
| `sme` | `Address` | Address of the SME/recipient receiving the funds |
| `token` | `Address` | Stablecoin token contract address used for this invoice |
| `principal` | `i128` | Total funding target (required amount) |
| `committed` | `i128` | Amount committed by all co-funders so far; equals `principal` when fully funded |
| `funded_at` | `u64` | Unix timestamp when fully funded (0 while still open for commitments) |
| `due_date` | `u64` | Invoice due date from the Invoice Contract |
| `repaid` | `bool` | Whether invoice has been repaid in full |

**Location in Source:** [contracts/pool/src/lib.rs](../contracts/pool/src/lib.rs)

**Notes:** When `committed == principal`, funds are automatically transferred to SME and `funded_at` is set to current ledger timestamp.

#### `CoFundKey`
Composite key uniquely identifying an investor's share in a specific invoice.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `invoice_id` | `u64` | Invoice ID |
| `investor` | `Address` | Investor address |

**Location in Source:** [contracts/pool/src/lib.rs](../contracts/pool/src/lib.rs)

**Notes:** Used internally for storage lookups; the value stored under this key is an `i128` representing the investor's committed share.

## Invoice Contract Methods

### `initialize` (Invoice)

Initializes the invoice contract with an admin address and authorized pool contract address. Can only be called once.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `env` | `Env` | Yes | Soroban environment context |
| `admin` | `Address` | Yes | Address that will be authorized to call `set_pool` and perform other privileged operations |
| `pool` | `Address` | Yes | Address of the pool contract authorized to call `mark_funded`, `mark_paid`, and `mark_defaulted` |

#### Returns

`()` — No return value.

#### Errors

| Error | Condition | Affected Methods |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| `"already initialized"` | Contract has been initialized before | `initialize` |

#### Access Control

None — The first caller wins. After initialization, the contract is locked. Use `set_pool` to update the pool contract address later (admin-only).

#### Example Invocation

From test [contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs#L287](../contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs#L287):

```rust
let admin = Address::generate(env);
let pool = Address::generate(env);
client.initialize(&admin, &pool);
```

CLI invocation:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source invoker \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --pool <POOL_CONTRACT_ID>
```

#### State Changes

- Sets `DataKey::Admin` to the provided `admin` address
- Sets `DataKey::Pool` to the provided `pool` address
- Initializes `DataKey::InvoiceCount` to `0`
- Sets `DataKey::Initialized` flag to `true`

---

### `create_invoice`

SME creates a new tokenized invoice on-chain. The owner must sign the transaction. Validates that amount is positive and due date is in the future.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `env` | `Env` | Yes | Soroban environment context |
| `owner` | `Address` | Yes | Address of the invoice creator (typically the SME); must sign the transaction |
| `debtor` | `String` | Yes | Name or label of the counterparty/debtor (e.g., "ACME Corp") |
| `amount` | `i128` | Yes | Face value in smallest units (7 decimals for USDC); must be > 0 |
| `due_date` | `u64` | Yes | Unix timestamp (ledger seconds) when payment is due; must be > current ledger timestamp |
| `description` | `String` | Yes | Human-readable invoice description (e.g., "Invoice #001 - Goods delivery") |

#### Returns

`u64` — The new invoice ID (sequential, starting from 1).

#### Errors

| Error | Condition | Affected Methods |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| `"amount must be positive"` | `amount <= 0` | `create_invoice` |
| `"due date must be in the future"` | `due_date <= env.ledger().timestamp()` | `create_invoice` |

#### Access Control

Requires `owner.require_auth()` — the caller must provide a cryptographic signature from the `owner` address.

#### Example Invocation

From test [contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs#L309](../contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs#L309):

```rust
let id = client.create_invoice(
    &sme,
    &String::from_str(&env, "ACME Corp"),
    &1_000_000_000i128,                      // 1000 USDC (7 decimals)
    &(env.ledger().timestamp() + 2_592_000), // 30 days
    &String::from_str(&env, "Invoice #001 - Goods delivery"),
);
// Returns invoice ID (1 for first invoice)
```

CLI invocation:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source owner_secret \
  -- create_invoice \
  --owner <OWNER_ADDRESS> \
  --debtor "ACME Corp" \
  --amount 1000000000 \
  --due_date 1735689600 \
  --description "Invoice #001 - Goods delivery"
```

#### State Changes

- Increments `DataKey::InvoiceCount`
- Creates and stores a new `Invoice` record with `status = InvoiceStatus::Pending`
- Sets `created_at` to current ledger timestamp
- Publishes an `INVOICE.created` event with `(id, owner, amount)`

#### Security Notes

**Trust Model:** Any address can create an invoice. The `owner` field identifies who can claim ownership.

**Invariants:**
- `amount > 0` — enforced
- `due_date > current_ledger_timestamp` — enforced
- New invoices always start in `Pending` state

**Validation:**
- Amount must be positive (rejects zero and negative)
- Due date must be in the future (rejects past or current timestamps)

---

### `mark_funded`

Called by the authorized pool contract when an invoice is fully funded and funds are disbursed to the SME. Transitions invoice status from `Pending` to `Funded`. Only the authorized pool address may call this method.

#### Returns

`()` — No return value.

#### Errors

| Error | Condition | Affected Methods |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| `"not initialized"` | Contract not initialized | `mark_funded` |

| `"invoice not found"` | Invoice ID does not exist | `mark_funded` |
| `"invoice is not pending"` | Invoice is not in `Pending` state | `mark_funded` |

#### Access Control

Requires `pool.require_auth()` — the authorized pool contract must provide a cryptographic signature.

#### Example Invocation

From test [contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs#L329](../contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs#L329):

```rust
client.mark_funded(&id, &pool);
// Status transitions to Funded, funded_at is set
```

CLI invocation:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source pool_secret \
  -- mark_funded \
  --id 1 \
  --pool <POOL_CONTRACT_ID>
```

#### State Changes

- Updates invoice status to `InvoiceStatus::Funded`
- Sets `funded_at` to current ledger timestamp
- Updates `pool_contract` field to the pool address
- Publishes an `INVOICE.funded` event with `(id)`

#### Security Notes

**Trust Model:** Only the registered pool contract can mark invoices as funded. This prevents unauthorized state transitions.

**Invariants:**
- Invoice must exist
- Invoice must be in `Pending` state (cannot re-fund an already funded or paid invoice)
- Caller must be the authorized pool address

---

### `mark_paid`

Marks an invoice as repaid in full. Can be called by the invoice owner, the pool contract, or the admin. Transitions invoice status from `Funded` to `Paid`.

| `"invoice not found"` | Invoice ID does not exist | `mark_paid` |
| `"unauthorized"` | Caller is not owner, pool, or admin | `mark_paid` |
| `"invoice is not funded"` | Invoice is not in `Funded` state | `mark_paid` |

#### Access Control

Requires `caller.require_auth()` — the caller must be the invoice owner, the authorized pool contract, or the admin address.

#### Example Invocation

From test [contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs#L331](../contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs#L331):

```rust
client.mark_paid(&id, &sme);  // sme can mark paid
// or
client.mark_paid(&id, &pool); // pool can mark paid
// or
client.mark_paid(&id, &admin); // admin can mark paid
```

CLI invocation:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source caller_secret \
  -- mark_paid \
  --id 1 \
  --caller <CALLER_ADDRESS>
```

#### State Changes

- Updates invoice status to `InvoiceStatus::Paid`
- Sets `paid_at` to current ledger timestamp
- Publishes an `INVOICE.paid` event with `(id)`

#### Security Notes

**Trust Model:** Three parties can mark an invoice as paid: the SME/owner, the pool, or the admin. This provides flexibility for different settlement workflows.

**Invariants:**
- Invoice must exist
- Invoice must be in `Funded` state
- Caller must be owner, pool, or admin

**Validation:**
- Enforces authorization check before allowing state transition

  --id 1 \
  --pool <POOL_CONTRACT_ID>
```

#### State Changes

- Updates invoice status to `InvoiceStatus::Defaulted`
- Publishes an `INVOICE.default` event with `(id)`

#### Security Notes

**Trust Model:** Only the pool contract can mark invoices as defaulted. This ensures consistent lifecycle management.

## Pool Contract Methods

### `initialize` (Pool)

Initializes the pool contract with an admin address, an initial stablecoin token, and the invoice contract address. Can only be called once. Sets up the default yield (800 basis points = 8% APY) and creates the initial token whitelist.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `env` | `Env` | Yes | Soroban environment context |
| `admin` | `Address` | Yes | Pool administrator address (required for `add_token`, `remove_token`, `init_co_funding`, `set_yield`) |
| `initial_token` | `Address` | Yes | Address of the first accepted stablecoin (typically USDC); can add more later via `add_token` |
| `invoice_contract` | `Address` | Yes | Address of the authorized Invoice Contract |

#### Returns

`()` — No return value.

#### Errors

| Error | Condition | Affected Methods |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| `"already initialized"` | Contract has been initialized before | `initialize` |

#### Access Control

None — the first caller wins. After initialization, the contract state is locked. Use privileged methods like `add_token` and `set_yield` to modify pool parameters.

#### Example Invocation

From test [contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L855](../contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L855):

```rust
let admin = Address::generate(env);
let usdc_id = env.register_stellar_asset_contract_v2(token_admin).address();
let invoice_contract = Address::generate(env);
client.initialize(&admin, &usdc_id, &invoice_contract);
```

CLI invocation:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <POOL_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source initializer \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --initial_token <USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
  --invoice_contract <INVOICE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

#### State Changes

- Sets `DataKey::Config` with admin, invoice_contract, and default yield_bps (800)
- Initializes `DataKey::AcceptedTokens` with a vector containing `[initial_token]`
- Creates `DataKey::TokenTotals(initial_token)` with all zeros
- Sets `DataKey::Initialized` flag to `true`

---

### `add_token`

Admin adds a stablecoin to the whitelist of accepted tokens. Investors can only deposit tokens on the whitelist. Fails if the token is already whitelisted.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `env` | `Env` | Yes | Soroban environment context |
| `admin` | `Address` | Yes | Admin address; must sign and match the stored admin |
| `token` | `Address` | Yes | Token contract address to add to the whitelist |

#### Returns

`()` — No return value.

#### Errors

| Error | Condition | Affected Methods |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| `"not initialized"` | Contract not initialized | `add_token` |
| `"unauthorized"` | `admin` does not match stored admin | `add_token` |
| `"token already accepted"` | Token is already in the whitelist | `add_token` |

#### Access Control

Requires `admin.require_auth()` and `require_admin` check — only the stored admin can add tokens.

#### Example Invocation

From test [contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L906](../contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L906):

```rust
let eur_admin = Address::generate(&env);
let eurc_id = env.register_stellar_asset_contract_v2(eur_admin).address();
client.add_token(&admin, &eurc_id);
```

CLI invocation:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <POOL_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source admin_secret \
  -- add_token \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --token <NEW_TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

#### State Changes

- Appends the token to `DataKey::AcceptedTokens` vector
- If `DataKey::TokenTotals(token)` doesn't exist, creates it with zeros

---

### `remove_token`

Admin removes a stablecoin from the whitelist. Only succeeds if the token has zero balances across all pools (total_deposited, total_deployed, and total_paid_out must all be 0). Prevents accidental removal of actively used tokens.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `env` | `Env` | Yes | Soroban environment context |
| `admin` | `Address` | Yes | Admin address; must sign and match the stored admin |
| `token` | `Address` | Yes | Token contract address to remove from the whitelist |

#### Returns

`()` — No return value.

#### Errors

| Error | Condition | Affected Methods |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| `"not initialized"` | Contract not initialized | `remove_token` |
| `"unauthorized"` | `admin` does not match stored admin | `remove_token` |
| `"token not in whitelist"` | Token is not in the accepted list | `remove_token` |
| `"token has non-zero pool balances"` | Token has nonzero total_deposited, total_deployed, or total_paid_out | `remove_token` |

#### Access Control

Requires `admin.require_auth()` and `require_admin` check — only the stored admin can remove tokens.

#### Example Invocation

From test [contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L919](../contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L919):

```rust
client.remove_token(&admin, &eurc_id);
```

CLI invocation:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <POOL_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source admin_secret \
  -- remove_token \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --token <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

#### State Changes

- Removes the token from `DataKey::AcceptedTokens` vector

#### Security Notes

**Invariants:**
- Token balances must be zero before removal prevents data loss and ensures clean state

---

### `deposit`

Investor deposits an accepted stablecoin into the pool. Funds are transferred from the investor's wallet to the pool contract. Creates or updates the investor's position for that token.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `env` | `Env` | Yes | Soroban environment context |
| `investor` | `Address` | Yes | Investor address; must sign the transaction |

`()` — No return value.

#### Errors

| Error | Condition | Affected Methods |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| `"not initialized"` | Contract not initialized | `deposit` |
| `"amount must be positive"` | `amount <= 0` | `deposit` |
| `"token not accepted"` | Token is not on the whitelist | `deposit` |

#### Access Control

Requires `investor.require_auth()` — the investor must provide a cryptographic signature. Token transfer is initiated by the pool contract and requires the investor's approval/signature for the transfer operation.

#### Example Invocation

From test [contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L869](../contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L869):

```rust
let investor = Address::generate(&env);
mint(&env, &usdc_id, &investor, 5_000_000_000);
client.deposit(&investor, &usdc_id, &2_000_000_000);

let pos = client.get_position(&investor, &usdc_id).unwrap();
assert_eq!(pos.deposited, 2_000_000_000);
assert_eq!(pos.available, 2_000_000_000);
```

CLI invocation:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <POOL_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source investor_secret \
  -- deposit \
  --investor <INVESTOR_ADDRESS> \
  --token <TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
  --amount 2000000000
```

#### State Changes

- Creates or updates investor's `InvestorPosition` for the token
- Increments `position.deposited` by amount
- Increments `position.available` by amount
- Increments `position.deposit_count` by 1
- Updates `TokenTotals.total_deposited` by amount
- Publishes a `POOL.deposit` event with `(investor, amount)`

#### Security Notes

**Trust Model:** Any address can deposit; positions are tracked per address and token.

**Invariants:**
- Amount must be positive
- Token must be whitelisted
- Investor's available balance increases by deposit amount

- Stores it under `DataKey::FundedInvoice(invoice_id)`
- Initializes empty `CoFunders` vector under `DataKey::CoFunders(invoice_id)`

---

### `commit_to_invoice`

Investor commits available balance toward an invoice. Moves funds from available to deployed in the investor's position. When the total committed reaches the principal target, USDC is automatically transferred to the SME and the invoice is marked as fully funded.

| `"insufficient available balance"` | `position.available < amount` | `commit_to_invoice` |

#### Access Control

Requires `investor.require_auth()` — the investor must provide a cryptographic signature.

#### Example Invocation

From test [contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L900](../contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L900):

```rust
client.commit_to_invoice(&investor1, &invoice_id, &2_000_000_000);
let record = client.get_funded_invoice(&invoice_id).unwrap();
assert_eq!(record.committed, 2_000_000_000);
assert_eq!(record.funded_at, 0);  // Not yet fully funded

client.commit_to_invoice(&investor2, &invoice_id, &1_000_000_000);
let record = client.get_funded_invoice(&invoice_id).unwrap();
assert_eq!(record.committed, principal);
assert!(record.funded_at != 0);  // Now fully funded
```

CLI invocation:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <POOL_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source investor_secret \
  -- commit_to_invoice \
  --investor <INVESTOR_ADDRESS> \
  --invoice_id 1 \
  --amount 2000000000
```

#### State Changes

- Updates investor's `InvestorPosition` for the invoice's token:
  - Decrements `available` by amount
  - Increments `deployed` by amount
- Updates `FundedInvoice.committed` by amount
- If this is the investor's first commitment to this invoice, adds investor to `CoFunders` list
- Stores investor's commitment under `CoFundShare(invoice_id, investor)` (cumulative; can commit multiple times)
- Updates `TokenTotals.total_deployed` by amount
- **If `committed == principal`:**
  - Transfers `principal` amount of stablecoin from pool contract to SME
  - Sets `FundedInvoice.funded_at` to current ledger timestamp
  - Publishes `POOL.funded` event with `(invoice_id, sme, principal)`

#### Security Notes

**Trust Model:** Investors can commit available balance; no approval from other parties required as long as available balance is sufficient.

**Invariants:**
- Investor must have deposited in the correct token first
- Available balance must be sufficient
- Cannot over-commit beyond the remaining funding gap
- Funds are automatically transferred to SME when fully funded (atomic operation)

---

### `repay_invoice`

|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `env` | `Env` | Yes | Soroban environment context |
| `invoice_id` | `u64` | Yes | Invoice ID to repay (must be funded and not already repaid) |
| `payer` | `Address` | Yes | Payer address (typically the SME); must sign the transaction |

#### Returns

`()` — No return value.

#### Errors

| Error | Condition | Affected Methods |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| `"not initialized"` | Contract not initialized | `repay_invoice` |
| `"invoice not found"` | Invoice ID doesn't exist in pool records | `repay_invoice` |
| `"invoice not fully funded yet"` | `funded_at == 0` | `repay_invoice` |
| `"already repaid"` | `repaid == true` | `repay_invoice` |

#### Access Control

Requires `payer.require_auth()` — the payer must provide a cryptographic signature. Token transfer requires approval/signature from the payer.

#### Example Invocation

From test [contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L1054](../contracts/pool/src/lib.rs#L1054):

```rust
env.ledger().with_mut(|l| l.timestamp += 2_592_000);  // 30 days pass

client.repay_invoice(&invoice_id, &sme);

let pos = client.get_position(&investor, &usdc_id).unwrap();
assert_eq!(pos.deployed, 0);
assert!(pos.available >= principal);  // Principal + interest
assert!(pos.earned > 0);
```

CLI invocation:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <POOL_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source payer_secret \
  -- repay_invoice \
  --invoice_id 1 \
  --payer <PAYER_ADDRESS>
```

#### State Changes

- Transfers total repayment (`principal + interest`) from payer to pool contract
- For each co-funder in the invoice:
  - Calculates their pro-rata share of interest
  - Updates their `InvestorPosition`:
    - Increments `available` by `(share + interest_share)`
    - Decrements `deployed` by `share`
    - Increments `earned` by `interest_share`
- Sets `FundedInvoice.repaid` to `true`
- Updates `TokenTotals`:
  - Decrements `total_deployed` by principal
  - Increments `total_paid_out` by total_due (principal + interest)
  - Increments `total_deposited` by interest (returned earnings)
- Publishes `POOL.repaid` event with `(invoice_id, principal, interest)`

**Interest Calculation:**
```
total_interest = (principal × yield_bps × elapsed_seconds) / (10000 × 31536000)
investor_interest = (total_interest × investor_share) / principal
```

#### Security Notes

**Trust Model:** SME or any authorized payer can repay. Repayment updates all investor positions atomically.

**Invariants:**
- Invoice must be fully funded before repayment
- Invoice can only be repaid once
- Interest is calculated and distributed based on actual elapsed time
- All co-funders' positions updated atomically
- No state changes if repayment fails (atomic)

---

### Pool Contract Errors

| Error Message | Meaning | Affected Methods |
|------|---------|---------|
| `"already initialized"` | Contract has been initialized before. Each contract can only be initialized once. | `initialize` |
| `"not initialized"` | Contract has not been initialized yet. All methods (except `initialize`) require initialization first. | `add_token`, `remove_token`, `deposit`, `init_co_funding`, `commit_to_invoice`, `repay_invoice`, `withdraw`, `set_yield`, `get_config`, `accepted_tokens`, `get_token_totals`, `available_liquidity`, `estimate_repayment` |
| `"amount must be positive"` | Amount parameter is <= 0. Deposits, commitments, and withdrawals require positive amounts. | `deposit`, `commit_to_invoice`, `withdraw` |
| `"unauthorized"` | Caller is not authorized. For admin-only methods: caller must match the stored admin address. | `add_token`, `remove_token`, `init_co_funding`, `set_yield` |
| `"token not accepted"` | Token is not on the whitelist of accepted tokens. | `deposit`, `init_co_funding` |
| `"token already accepted"` | Token is already on the whitelist. Cannot add a duplicate. | `add_token` |
| `"token not in whitelist"` | Token is not on the whitelist. Cannot remove a token that was never added. | `remove_token` |
| `"token has non-zero pool balances"` | Token has nonzero `total_deposited`, `total_deployed`, or `total_paid_out`. Cannot remove a token with active balances. | `remove_token` |
| `"principal must be positive"` | Principal is <= 0. Invoice funding targets must be positive. | `init_co_funding` |
| `"invoice already registered for funding"` | Invoice ID was already opened for co-funding. Cannot register the same invoice twice. | `init_co_funding` |
| `"invoice not registered for co-funding"` | Invoice ID is not registered for co-funding. Often indicates the invoice does not exist in the pool's records. | `commit_to_invoice` |
| `"invoice already fully funded"` | Invoice is already fully funded (`funded_at != 0`). Cannot commit to a funded invoice. | `commit_to_invoice` |
| `"invoice already repaid"` | Invoice has been repaid (`repaid == true`). Cannot commit to a repaid invoice or repay twice. | `commit_to_invoice`, `repay_invoice` |
| `"amount exceeds remaining funding gap"` | Commitment amount exceeds the remaining principal to be funded. Cannot over-commit. | `commit_to_invoice` |
| `"investor has no position in this invoice token"` | Investor has never deposited in this token. Must deposit before committing. | `commit_to_invoice` |
| `"insufficient available balance"` | Investor's available balance is less than the requested amount. | `commit_to_invoice`, `withdraw` |
| `"invoice not found"` | Invoice ID not found in pool records. | `repay_invoice` |
| `"invoice not fully funded yet"` | Invoice is not fully funded (`funded_at == 0`). Cannot repay before the invoice is fully funded. | `repay_invoice` |
| `"no position found"` | Investor has no position in this token. Must deposit before withdrawing. | `withdraw` |
| `"yield cannot exceed 50%"` | Yield in basis points exceeds 5000 (50% APY). | `set_yield` |
| `"invoice not funded"` (in estimate_repayment) | Invoice is not registered for co-funding. | `estimate_repayment` |

## Additional Notes

### Interest Calculation

Interest on invoices is calculated using a simple formula, not compound interest:

$$\text{interest} = \frac{\text{principal} \times \text{yield\_bps} \times \text{elapsed\_seconds}}{10000 \times 31536000}$$

Where:
- **principal**: Invoice principal amount
- **yield_bps**: Annual yield in basis points (e.g., 800 = 8%)
- **elapsed_seconds**: Time in seconds from when the invoice was fully funded to when it is repaid
- **10000**: Basis points denominator
- **31536000**: Seconds per year (365 days)

When multiple investors have co-funded an invoice, each investor's share of interest is:

$$\text{investor\_interest} = \frac{\text{total\_interest} \times \text{investor\_share}}{\text{principal}}$$

### Decimal Conventions

- **USDC on Stellar**: 7 decimals (1 USDC = 10,000,000 in smallest units)
- All amounts in the contract are `i128` integers representing the smallest units
- When displaying to users, divide by $10^7$ for USDC

### Event Publishing

Both contracts emit events for tracking state changes. Events are published with a contract-specific topic:
- **Invoice Contract**: Topic `INVOICE`
- **Pool Contract**: Topic `POOL`

Refer to the contract source code for the complete event schemas.

### Storage Organization

- **Instance Storage**: Fast, limited capacity; used for configuration and initialization flags
- **Persistent Storage**: Slower, unlimited capacity; used for Invoice records, investor positions, and funded invoice details

Queries against persistent storage may have latency; batch queries when possible.
