# Funding Pool Contract — API Documentation

Soroban smart contract for pooled invoice funding on Stellar. Investors deposit accepted stablecoins, co-fund invoices, and earn time-based yield on repayments.

---

## Overview

The Funding Pool enables:

- **Multi-token support** — admin can whitelist multiple stablecoins (USDC, EURC, etc.)
- **Co-funding** — multiple investors combine capital to fund a single invoice
- **Pro-rata yield** — interest distributed proportionally to each co-funder's share
- **Position tracking** — per-investor, per-token balances and earnings

---

## Constants

| Constant | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEFAULT_YIELD_BPS` | `800` | Default annual yield (8% APY) |
| `BPS_DENOM` | `10_000` | Basis points denominator |
| `SECS_PER_YEAR` | `31_536_000` | Seconds per year (365 days) |

---

## Data Structures

### PoolConfig

}
```

### InvestorPosition

Per-investor, per-token position tracking.

```rust
pub struct InvestorPosition {
    pub deposited: i128,     // Total amount deposited (net of withdrawals)
    pub available: i128,     // Undeployed balance available for withdrawal/funding
    pub deployed: i128,      // Amount locked in active invoices

## Public Functions

### initialize

```rust
pub fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address, initial_token: Address, invoice_contract: Address)

---

### deposit

```rust
pub fn deposit(env: Env, investor: Address, token: Address, amount: i128)
```

Investor deposits an accepted stablecoin into the pool. Token is transferred from investor to the pool contract.

---

### commit_to_invoice

```rust
pub fn commit_to_invoice(env: Env, investor: Address, invoice_id: u64, amount: i128)
```

---

### repay_invoice

```rust
pub fn repay_invoice(env: Env, invoice_id: u64, payer: Address)
```

SME repays the invoice. The payer transfers `principal + accrued interest + factoring fee` to the pool. Each co-funder's position is credited with their proportional share of principal + interest, while the factoring fee is retained as protocol revenue.

**Interest formula:**
```
interest = (principal × yield_bps × elapsed_seconds) / (BPS_DENOM × SECS_PER_YEAR)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invoice_id` | `u64` | Invoice to repay |
| `payer` | `Address` | Wallet paying the repayment (must sign) |

**Auth:** `payer.require_auth()`

**Panics:**

**Events:** `repaid` — `(invoice_id, principal, interest)`

---

### withdraw

```rust
pub fn withdraw(env: Env, investor: Address, token: Address, amount: i128)

- `"no position found"` — investor has no position
- `"insufficient available balance"` — not enough available balance

**Events:** `withdraw` — `(investor, amount)`

---

```

Admin updates the pool's annual yield rate.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `admin` | `Address` | Pool admin (must sign) |
| `yield_bps` | `u32` | New yield in basis points (e.g. `1000` = 10%) |

**Auth:** `admin.require_auth()`

**Panics:**
- `"unauthorized"` — caller is not admin
- `"yield cannot exceed 50%"` — yield_bps > 5000

---

### set_factoring_fee

```rust
pub fn set_factoring_fee(env: Env, admin: Address, factoring_fee_bps: u32)
```

Admin updates the factoring fee charged when an invoice becomes fully funded.

## Interest Calculation

```
interest = (principal × yield_bps × elapsed_seconds) / (10_000 × 31_536_000)
```

- `principal` — invoice face value
- `yield_bps` — annual yield in basis points (e.g. 800 = 8%)
- `elapsed_seconds` — time between `funded_at` and repayment
- Interest is distributed proportionally to co-funders based on their share of the principal

---

## Co-Funding Workflow

```
1. Admin:    init_co_funding(invoice_id, principal, sme, due_date, token)
2. Investor: commit_to_invoice(investor, invoice_id, amount)
   ... repeat until committed == principal ...
3. Auto:     Stablecoin disbursed to SME; "funded" event emitted
4. SME:      repay_invoice(invoice_id, payer)
5. Auto:     Principal + interest credited to each co-funder's available balance
```
