# Astera

**Real World Assets on Stellar. Invoice financing for emerging markets.**

Astera lets SMEs tokenize unpaid invoices as Soroban-based RWA tokens. Community investors
fund a USDC liquidity pool. Smart contracts handle escrow, repayment, and yield distribution.
Every paid invoice builds an on-chain credit history.

---

## Architecture

```
contracts/
  invoice/   — RWA invoice token contract (Soroban/Rust)
  pool/      — Liquidity pool + yield distribution (Soroban/Rust)
frontend/    — Next.js 14 app (Freighter wallet, Stellar SDK)
```

## Contracts

### Invoice Contract

- `create_invoice` — SME mints an invoice token with amount, debtor, due date
- `mark_funded` — Called by pool when invoice is funded
- `mark_paid` — SME or pool marks invoice as repaid
- `mark_defaulted` — Pool flags missed repayment

### Pool Contract

- `initialize` — Sets admin, first accepted stablecoin (`initial_token`), and invoice contract
- `add_token` / `remove_token` — Admin maintains a whitelist of accepted stablecoin SAC addresses
- `deposit` — Investor deposits a whitelisted stablecoin into the pool (positions are per token)
- `init_co_funding` — Admin opens an invoice for co-funding in a specific stablecoin
- `commit_to_invoice` — Investors commit **available balance in that invoice’s token** until the principal target is met
- `repay_invoice` — SME repays principal + simple interest (8% APY default) **in the same token the invoice was funded with**
- `withdraw` — Investor withdraws available (undeployed) balance **in the chosen token**

## Setup

### Rapid Local Development (Docker Compose)
We provide a one-command setup using Docker Compose that spins up the Stellar local network, the Next.js frontend, a contracts development environment, and mock services.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
After running this command:
- **Frontend** is available at http://localhost:3000
- **Stellar RPC** is available at http://localhost:8000
- **Mock Services** are available at http://localhost:4000

---

### Manual Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Rust + Cargo](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/stellar-cli)
- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Freighter wallet](https://www.freighter.app/) browser extension

### 1. Build contracts

```bash
cd astera
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### 2. Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Fund a testnet account
stellar keys generate --global deployer --network testnet
stellar keys fund deployer --network testnet

# Deploy invoice contract
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/invoice.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet

# Deploy pool contract
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/pool.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

### 3. Initialize contracts

```bash
# Initialize invoice contract
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <YOUR_ADDRESS> \
  --pool <POOL_CONTRACT_ID>

# Initialize pool contract
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <POOL_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <YOUR_ADDRESS> \
  --usdc_token <USDC_TOKEN_ID> \
  --invoice_contract <INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID>
```

### 4. Run frontend

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in contract IDs in .env.local

npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## User Flows

### SME Flow

1. Connect Freighter wallet
2. Go to **New Invoice** — fill debtor, amount, due date
3. Sign transaction — invoice minted on Stellar
4. Monitor status on **Dashboard** — see funding, credit score
5. When customer pays, call `repay_invoice` to settle

### Investor Flow

1. Connect Freighter wallet
2. Go to **Invest** — choose a whitelisted stablecoin and deposit into the pool
3. Pool admin deploys liquidity to approved invoices
4. When invoices are repaid, yield accumulates in the pool
5. Withdraw available balance anytime

---

## Testnet USDC

Use the Stellar testnet USDC asset or deploy a mock token:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <TOKEN_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- mint \
  --to <YOUR_ADDRESS> \
  --amount 1000000000000
```

## Deployment

### Testnet Deployment

For development and testing, see the [Testnet Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### Mainnet Deployment

For production deployment, see the comprehensive [Mainnet Deployment Guide](docs/mainnet-deployment.md) which includes:

- Pre-deployment security checklist
- Contract verification procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Rollback and emergency procedures
- Post-deployment verification steps

**⚠️ Important:** Mainnet deployment involves real assets. Complete all security audits and testing before deploying to production.
