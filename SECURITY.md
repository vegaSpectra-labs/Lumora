# Security Policy

## Overview

Astera takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and how security auditing is integrated into our development process.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Testnet | :white_check_mark: |
| Mainnet | :x: (pending audit) |

## Security Auditing

### Automated Security Checks

Our CI/CD pipeline includes the following automated security checks:

1. **cargo-audit** - Scans Rust dependencies for known vulnerabilities
   - Runs on every PR and push to main
   - Checks against RustSec Advisory Database

2. **Clippy** - Rust linter with security-focused lints
   - Enforces `#![no_std]` compatibility
   - Checks for unsafe code patterns
   - Runs with `-D warnings` (deny all warnings)

3. **npm audit** - Scans Node.js dependencies
   - Fails on high/critical severity vulnerabilities
   - Runs for frontend dependencies

### Static Analysis

The following static analysis tools are used:

| Tool | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------|
| cargo-clippy | Rust linting | Every PR |
| cargo-audit | Dependency scanning | Every PR |
| npm audit | Node.js dependency scanning | Every PR |
| rustfmt | Code formatting enforcement | Every PR |

### Security Best Practices for Contracts

All smart contracts follow these security practices:

1. **Authentication**: All state-changing operations require `.require_auth()` on the caller
2. **No unsafe code**: Contracts use `#![no_std]` and avoid unsafe blocks
3. **Integer overflow protection**: Enabled in release profile
4. **Error handling**: Explicit error messages for all failure cases
5. **Events**: All state changes emit events for transparency
6. **TTL management**: Proper storage TTL handling to prevent data loss

### Access Control Matrix

| Operation | Invoice Contract | Pool Contract | Credit Score |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Initialize | Admin | Admin | Admin |
| Create Invoice | Any (authenticated) | - | - |
| Fund Invoice | Pool only | Investors | - |
| Mark Paid | Owner/Pool/Admin | - | - |
| Mark Defaulted | Pool only | - | - |
| Add Token | - | Admin | - |
| Set Oracle | Admin | - | - |
| Record Payment | - | - | Pool only |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security details to: [security contact to be added]
3. Include:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide a timeline for a fix within 5 business days
- Keep you updated on progress
- Credit you in the advisory (with your permission)

## Security Checklist for Deployment

Before any deployment:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] cargo-audit shows no vulnerabilities
- [ ] Clippy shows no warnings
- [ ] Code review by at least one maintainer
- [ ] Security review for contract changes
- [ ] Events emitted for all state changes
- [ ] TTL properly configured for all storage

## Regular Security Audits

Security audits are scheduled:
- **Weekly**: Automated dependency scanning (cargo-audit, npm audit)
- **Every PR**: Static analysis and linting
- **Monthly**: Manual review of contract changes
- **Quarterly**: Third-party security audit (planned for mainnet)
